I've placed all programs for PC's inside the computer folder. There is a turtle folder too, for Turtles.


INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE WITUR
Download the witur program for computer, go in your world and type ID on the computer you want to use to control the turtles. Then, place the witur program for computer on /.minecraft/saves/YOURWORLDNAME/computer/COMPUTER-ID/.
For Turtles, do the same. Then, place the wireless modem on the left side of the computer. Now, run witur on Turtle and the Computer and you can control Turtles with a computer via wifi!
